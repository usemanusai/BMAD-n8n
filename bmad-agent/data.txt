## PROJECT OVERVIEW

The n8n Workflow Automation BMAD System provides a structured, collaborative, and adaptable methodology for developing complex, automated workflows in n8n. This system addresses the unique challenges of n8n development, including version-specific limitations, dynamic requirements, and the complexity of workflow design.

**Problem Statement:** The process of developing complex, automated workflows in n8n requires a structured, collaborative, and adaptable methodology, especially when navigating version-specific limitations and dynamic requirements. This document formalizes the "BMAD" set of rules and agent-based interaction models for building reliable n8n automation projects, minimizing errors and miscommunication.

## VISION & GOALS

**Vision:** To establish a framework where a "Vibe CEO" (the user) can rapidly and reliably architect and implement powerful, custom n8n workflows by directing specialized AI assistants (the BMAD agents).

**Primary Goals:**

1. **Define Clear Agent Personas:** Establish specialized agent personas tailored for n8n workflow development (n8n Workflow Architect, n8n Platform Engineer) to ensure role clarity and expertise.

2. **Formalize Interactive Command System:** Create a predictable and user-driven development experience through commands like /SAFE-GUARD-ON, /DIAGRAMS-ON, and navigation controls.

3. **Establish Visual Validation Standards:** Use visual aids and checklists to validate each stage of the build process, ensuring quality and accuracy throughout the development lifecycle.

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduction in the number of errors and debugging loops during workflow creation
- Faster time from initial concept to a fully functional, deployed workflow
- Increased user confidence and satisfaction with the development process

## TARGET AUDIENCE

The primary user is the "Vibe CEO"â€”the project lead or developer who provides the high-level vision and directs the AI assistant through the workflow creation process. This user:
- Has business requirements for workflow automation
- May have varying levels of n8n technical expertise
- Values structured, guided development processes
- Requires reliable, error-free workflow implementations

## KEY FEATURES & SCOPE

### 1. Defined Agent Personas

**BMAD Orchestrator:** The default, top-level agent that guides the overall process and helps select the correct specialist. Its primary knowledge is the n8n BMAD method itself.

**n8n Workflow Architect (Fred):** Responsible for designing the logical flow of the n8n workflow, selecting appropriate nodes, and defining the data structures that pass between them. Specializes in:
- Node selection and configuration
- Data flow architecture
- Workflow pattern design
- Version compatibility considerations

**n8n Platform Engineer (Alex):** Responsible for the n8n environment itself, including docker-compose.yml configuration, building custom Docker images with new dependencies, and troubleshooting environment-level errors. Specializes in:
- Environment configuration
- Docker and containerization
- Custom dependency management
- Platform-level troubleshooting

### 2. Core Interaction Protocol & Commands

The interaction is governed by a set of commands to give users full control over the development process:

**Safety Commands:**
- **/SAFE-GUARD-ON** (Default): The AI assistant will not proceed to the next step of building or configuring a node until the user provides a screenshot confirming the successful completion of the current step. This is the most critical rule to prevent errors.
- **/YOLO-ON & /YOLO-OFF**:
  - YOLO-ON: Turns Safeguard OFF. The user provides a high-level goal, and the AI generates the complete workflow JSON at once. (Not Recommended)
  - YOLO-OFF (Default): The step-by-step, collaborative build process

**Navigation Commands:**
- **/BACK**: Focus on the previous node or instruction step
- **/FORWARD**: Move to the next logical step
- **/ALTERNATIVE**: Request a different technical approach or node suggestion for the current problem
- **/exit**: The current agent persona is abandoned, and the system reverts to the base BMAD Orchestrator

## VISUAL AID SYSTEM

- **/DIAGRAMS-ON** (Default): The AI assistant is required to provide a simple, text-based visual diagram for any instruction that involves changing the workflow's connections or overall structure
- **/DIAGRAMS-OFF**: Disables the generation of visual diagrams

Visual diagrams help users understand workflow structure changes and validate the logical flow before implementation.

## VALIDATION CHECKLISTS

The system uses checklists to validate key stages, ensuring all requirements are met before proceeding:

- **n8n Architect Checklist**: Validates the final workflow logic against all requirements, including node selection, data flow, error handling, and performance considerations
- **n8n Platform Engineer Checklist**: Validates environment changes including docker-compose.yml, Dockerfile modifications, dependency installations, and security configurations

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS & PREFERENCES

**Known Constraints:**
- The AI assistant's training data may not be up-to-date with the latest version of n8n
- Therefore, the /SAFE-GUARD-ON protocol is essential to verify the UI and node names at each step

**Architectural Preferences:**
- **Linear "Pass-Through" Workflows**: For complex data-passing scenarios in n8n, a linear "pass-through" workflow is preferred over multi-input nodes or expressions that reference distant nodes ($('Node Name')), as this has proven to be more robust against version-specific bugs
- **Step-by-Step Development**: The user prefers a guided, step-by-step process with clear visual aids for all but the simplest tasks
- **Screenshot Validation**: Critical for ensuring UI compatibility across n8n versions

## AGENT ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES

### BMAD Orchestrator
- Guides overall n8n workflow development process

## n8n NODE AND TRIGGER REFERENCE

### TRIGGER CATEGORIES AND USE CASES

n8n workflows can be initiated through nine different trigger categories, each serving specific automation needs:

**1. Trigger Manually**
- Runs the flow on clicking a button in n8n
- Good for getting started quickly and testing workflows

**2. On App Event**
- Runs the flow when something happens in an app like Telegram, Notion or Airtable
- Ideal for real-time integrations and event-driven automation

**3. On a Schedule**
- Runs the flow every day, hour, or custom interval
- Perfect for recurring tasks and batch processing

**4. On Webhook Call**
- Runs the flow on receiving an HTTP request
- Essential for API integrations and external system triggers

**5. On Form Submission**
- Generate webforms in n8n and pass their responses to the workflow
- Excellent for data collection and user input processing

**6. When Executed by Another Workflow**
- Runs the flow when called by the Execute Workflow node from a different workflow
- Enables modular workflow architecture and reusability

**7. On Chat Message**
- Runs the flow when a user sends a chat message
- For use with AI nodes and conversational interfaces

**8. When Running Evaluation**
- Run a dataset through your workflow to test performance
- Critical for workflow testing and quality assurance

**9. Other Ways**
- Runs the flow on workflow errors, file changes, etc.
- Specialized triggers for advanced use cases

## n8n BMAD METHOD PRINCIPLES

The n8n BMAD Method emphasizes:

1. **Safety-First Development**: Use safeguard protocols to prevent errors
2. **Visual Validation**: Require diagrams for structural changes
3. **Iterative Refinement**: Build workflows step-by-step with user confirmation
4. **Version Awareness**: Account for n8n UI and feature changes across versions
5. **Linear Design Patterns**: Prefer simple, maintainable workflow structures
6. **Collaborative Development**: Maintain constant user-agent communication
7. **Error Prevention**: Focus on preventing issues rather than fixing them later
8. **Documentation Excellence**: Maintain clear documentation throughout development
